How does a programming novice develop a computer game? We investigated this question in the context of a seminar. We applied the Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern to Sandblocks, a block-based editor for Squeak, and created a block-based editor called ECSBlocks, which aims to allowing programming novices to start developing games as easily as possible. Buttons with unique icons and blocks that can be expanded and collapsed as well as dragged and dropped require little prior knowledge of the programming language Smalltalk. Programming knowledge is only required for the systems that control the state and behavior of the entities and components. However, by initially loading a relatively simple game universe, this is made easier as the universe already contains working systems and these can be adapted and extended as required or used as a template. This is a first step to make programming games with ECS easier. Next, it will be important to deal with palettes.
